Hello.

Yes. Rajiv can you hear me?

Yeah, I can hear you.

Hi. This is Austin Taun from Taipei, Taiwan.

Hi Austin. How are you?

I'm fine. Okay... So today, Rajiv could you first introduce yourself a little bit?

Sure. Well I'm a Telecom ____ here. I graduated sometime in 1999. And after that I worked for some various companies out here. My last company that I worked for was Lucent. And then after that I started off on my own. And for the past two years I've been trying to do this Sedna Wireless thing. As part of Sedna Wireless we released Call Graph.

Okay. The reason that I know your company, Sedna Wireless is because this product Call Graph, yeah, I think that's, if I think correctly it's kind of like Skype recorder. It's like a plugin for Skype, right.

It is a call recording application for Skype. It works in the background and it records all your calls into an mp3 file. And then you can play it back, you can search through your call records. It's basically meant for... It's a productivity application. Somebody who would like to have records of his calls, he can use our software.

Yes. And the reason that I found it interesting is that, I'm not sure if you aware of this fact, your software Call Graph seems to be the only one that can be used for free! And with the functionality of Stereo. What I mean is that your software Call Graph can record the conversation into separate audio tracks. So that will be perfect choice for Podcasts. Because most of the ___ come into the situation that the two people have different volumes. So it will be very very hard to do the modification, to do the post production.

Right. That's true. We record it in separate tracks which makes it very easy to edit the files. You can use any external audio editor. For example, Audacity is a very good audio editor. And you can export the tracks separately. Plus there is also a feature in which you can record the calls in a wav file. So if you do record the calls in a wav file then you don't lose any quality. The quality is maintained, of the call.

Yes. So I think, frankly there are other software in the market that provide the same functionality of separate tracks. But they all require, a little bit registration fee. So it's a very very outstanding point, from my point of view.

Yes. Great that you like Call Graph.

So I think you should emphasize this point. I actually spent several days to search through the Internet about Skype recording solutions. And I was very surprised that Call Graph was not mentioned very much. It only has 50,000 Google hits, compared to other software, maybe several million hits.

Well one of the reason is that we released it recently, it's around just two months old. And it got covered by a few popular weblogs, few popular Blogs. For example LifeHacker covered us. And DownloadSquad covered us. But I guess it takes some time to spread through the Google's network.
